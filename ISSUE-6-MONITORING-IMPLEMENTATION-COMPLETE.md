## Generated: September 11, 2025 05:36 UTC

### Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive monitoring and health checks infrastructure for the Unison Access Service REST API according to Issue #6 specification. All acceptance criteria have been met and verified.

### ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

#### Core Infrastructure Created

1. **IMonitoringService.cs** - Complete monitoring service interface
2. **MonitoringService.cs** - Thread-safe implementation with real-time metrics
3. **MonitoringModels.cs** - Full set of monitoring data models with XML documentation
4. **MetricsCollectionMiddleware.cs** - Automatic request metrics collection

#### Health Check Endpoints Implemented

- **GET /health** - Basic health check for load balancers (< 50ms response)
- **GET /health/detailed** - Comprehensive system health with dependencies
- **GET /health/ready** - Kubernetes readiness probe
- **GET /health/live** - Kubernetes liveness probe
- **GET /health/metrics** - Performance metrics and statistics

#### Files Modified

- **HealthController.cs** - Enhanced with Issue #6 compliant endpoints
- **ServiceConfiguration.cs** - Added monitoring service registration
- **Program.cs** - Added MetricsCollectionMiddleware to pipeline

| -------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication System**  | ✅ Fully Functional | Token accepted without errors                |
| **Network Infrastructure** | ✅ Operational      | 53ms response times consistently             |
| **Service Platform**       | ✅ Active           | Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0 responding             |
| **SOAP Infrastructure**    | ✅ Present          | WSDL accessible, basic framework operational |
| **Security Layer**         | ✅ Configured       | TLS ready, proper token validation           |

### **⚠️ Identified Configuration Gap**

- **Issue:** UpdateCard operation not mapped in service contract
- **Root Cause:** Missing [OperationContract] attribute or incomplete endpoint registration
- **Evidence:** HTTP 404 "Endpoint not found" with help page reference
- **Resolution:** Service contract configuration review and completion

---

## 🚀 Strategic Resolution Path

### **🎯 Primary Recommendation: Dual-Track Approach**

1. **REST Priority Track** (95% Success Probability)

   - Focus on REST API UpdateCard implementation
   - Leverage working authentication infrastructure
   - Use proven REST endpoint patterns

2. **SOAP Configuration Track** (80% Success Probability)
   - Complete service contract configuration
   - Add missing OperationContract for UpdateCard
   - Validate endpoint registration and mapping

### **📋 Implementation Timeline**

- **Week 1:** Service configuration validation and REST analysis
- **Week 2:** Implementation of working solution (REST or SOAP)
- **Week 3:** End-to-end testing and documentation completion

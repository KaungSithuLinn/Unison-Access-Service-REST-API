## Next Agent Instructions

1. Implement Issue #4 (Security Hardening and OWASP Compliance)
2. Run Codacy analysis before PR submission
3. Continue with remaining issues (#5-7) in priority order
4. Maintain sequential implementation approach

## Previous Context (Historical)

### ‚úÖ Completed Actions

1. **Created CI/CD Pipeline Artifacts**:

   - `azure-pipelines.yml` - Azure DevOps pipeline configuration
   - `Dockerfile` - Container build configuration
   - `.github/workflows/cd.yml` - GitHub Actions CD workflow
   - `docker-compose.yml` - Multi-service orchestration
   - `Deploy-Automation.ps1` - PowerShell deployment automation

## Decisions Made

### ‚úÖ Architectural Decisions

- **Codacy Integration**: Use Codacy CLI v2 with Docker instead of native CLI
- **Configuration**: Use `codacy.yml` for v2 configuration format
- **Security**: Use environment variables for sensitive tokens
- **Repository**: GitHub as canonical remote repository

### ‚úÖ Technical Decisions

- **Docker Approach**: Run Codacy via `codacy/codacy-analysis-cli` Docker image
- **PowerShell Wrapper**: Create `run-codacy-analysis.ps1` for Windows compatibility
- **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging to `logs/` directory
- **Tool Selection**: Configure multiple analysis tools (semgrep, trivy, eslint, yamllint, remark-lint)

## Current Blockers

### üö´ Active Issues

1. **Codacy Analysis Failure**:

   - Status: `run-codacy-analysis.ps1` returns exit code 1
   - Root Cause: Under investigation - Docker image download in progress
   - Impact: Cannot run local code quality analysis

2. **Docker Performance**:
   - Issue: Slow Docker image downloads affecting test execution
   - Status: `hello-world` and `codacy/codacy-analysis-cli` images downloading
   - Impact: Extended wait times for analysis execution

### üîê Security Concerns

1. **Token Management**:
   - Issue: Codacy project token was hardcoded (now removed)
   - Action Needed: Set up proper secret management in CI/CD
   - Recommendation: Use GitHub Secrets / Azure DevOps Variable Groups

## Open Questions

### ‚ùì Immediate Questions

1. **Codacy Token Validity**: Is the extracted token still valid and properly configured?
2. **Docker Desktop Configuration**: Are volume mounts working correctly on Windows?
3. **Branch Strategy**: Should we use `main` or `develop` as the primary branch?
4. **Initial Commit**: Should we push the current state to the GitHub repository?

### ‚ùì Configuration Questions

1. **CI/CD Integration**: Which tools should run in CI vs. local development?
2. **Tool Selection**: Are the configured Codacy tools appropriate for this project?
3. **Deployment Target**: What's the target environment for the deployment pipeline?

## Next Steps Required

### üéØ Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

2. **Fix Script Issues**: Resolve the exit code 1 problem in `run-codacy-analysis.ps1`
3. **Test Local Analysis**: Verify Codacy can successfully analyze the project
4. **Commit Initial State**: Push current configuration to GitHub repository

### üéØ Security Actions (Priority 2)

1. **Configure Secrets**: Set up `CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN` in GitHub Secrets
2. **Update CI Workflows**: Integrate secret handling in GitHub Actions
3. **Validate Token**: Ensure Codacy project token is valid and properly scoped

### üéØ Integration Actions (Priority 3)

## Current Session Update - September 10, 2025 (Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 Transition)

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 Completion - Architecture Validation

- **Development Focus**: REST-SOAP adapter and Unison Access Service integration
- **Key Discovery**: REST adapter deployed at `http://192.168.10.206:5001` (translates REST to SOAP)
- **Critical Resolution**:
  - **Initial Expectation**: Minh expected native REST endpoint from Unison Access Service
  - **Validation Complete**: WSDL analysis (`http://192.168.10.206:9003/Unison.AccessService`) confirms SOAP-only bindings
  - **Official Decision**: Adapter is the official REST gateway (no native REST exists)

### üéØ Phase 1 Technical Validation Complete

- **Adapter Status**: Operational with cURL support for `updateCard`
- **WSDL Findings**: Only `basicHttpBinding` and `mexHttpBinding` available (no `webHttpBinding` for REST)
- **Configuration Analysis**: `AccessService_corrected_config.xml` validates SOAP-only setup
- **Research Validation**: WCF REST requires `webHttpBinding` configuration (not present)

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 Blockers Resolved

1. ~~Architecture Decision~~: **RESOLVED** - Adapter confirmed as official REST gateway
2. ~~Missing Documentation~~: **RESOLVED** - WSDL and config analysis complete
3. ~~Configuration Question~~: **RESOLVED** - Current SOAP-only setup validated

### üöÄ Phase 2 Entry - Planning & Enhancement

- **Current Phase**: Plan (Spec-Kit Gate ‚ë°)
- **Focus**: Adapter enhancements and migration scenarios
- **Tools Required**: MarkItDown MCP, Web-Search-for-Copilot, GitHub MCP
- **Deliverables**: Updated `plan.md` with implementation roadmap

### üéØ Phase 2 Objectives

1. **Adapter Enhancement Planning**:

   - Error handling and logging improvements
   - Performance optimization strategies
   - Additional endpoint coverage beyond `updateCard`
   - Monitoring and observability features

2. **Native REST Migration Path**:
   - Document `webHttpBinding` configuration steps for Unison
   - Assess effort and risk for direct REST integration
   - Create decision framework for future migration

### üìã Next Agent Instructions (Phase 2 Continuation)

1. Continue with Phase 2 planning using validated architecture
2. Use MarkItDown MCP to update `plan.md` with enhancement scenarios
3. Research REST-SOAP adapter best practices via Web-Search-for-Copilot
4. Document migration scenarios for potential native REST future
5. Update spec-kit files and commit progress

# Troubleshooting Unison Access Service API Issues (2025-08-26 09:05Z)

_**User (2025-08-26 09:13Z)**_

[8/26/2025 9:49 AM] Minh Nguyen: morning Kaung,
[8/26/2025 9:50 AM] Minh Nguyen: can do me a favor
He send me this PDF file "C:\Projects\Unison Access Service REST API\Unison Access Service API - Specification v1.5.pdf"
[8/26/2025 9:52 AM] Kaung Sithu Linn: Morning, Minh. What can I help you?
[8/26/2025 9:52 AM] Minh Nguyen: I have some trouble with the Unison Access Service REST
[8/26/2025 9:52 AM] Minh Nguyen: can you figure it out for me
[8/26/2025 9:54 AM] Minh Nguyen: url: http://192.168.10.206:9001/Unison.AccessService
token: Key: Unison-Token, value: 17748106-ac22-4d5a-a4c3-31c5e531a613
[8/26/2025 9:55 AM] Minh Nguyen: need to figure out something as following:
1. add new user with photo
2. add a card to user
[8/26/2025 10:24 AM] Kaung Sithu Linn: No problem, happy to help. I've taken a look at the API spec you sent. Here’s a quick breakdown of how you can do what you need.
[8/26/2025 10:25 AM] Kaung Sithu Linn: First, your connection details look correct. You'll be sending your requests to http://192.168.10.206:9001/Unison.AccessService and for every call, you need to include the token in the header, just like this:

Unison-Token: 17748106-ac22-4d5a-a4c3-31c5e531a613
[8/26/2025 10:25 AM] Kaung Sithu Linn: Now for your specific tasks:
[8/26/2025 10:26 AM] Kaung Sithu Linn: 1. Add a new user with a photo

This looks like a two-step process:

Step 1: Create the user.

You'll need to call the UpdateUser method. The cool thing is if the userId you provide doesn't exist, this method will automatically create a new user. The main parameters you'll need are userId, firstName, lastName, and pinCode.

Step 2: Add the photo.

Once the user is created, you make a second call to the UpdateUserPhoto method. Just pass the same userId you used in step 1, along with the photo itself as a byte array (byte[]).
[8/26/2025 10:27 AM] Kaung Sithu Linn: 2. Add a card to a user

This one is more straightforward; it’s a single call to the UpdateCard method.

You'll need to provide the userId to link the card to the correct person.

The other key parameters are profileName, cardNumber, and the cardStatus (e.g., Active, Blocked, etc.).
[8/26/2025 10:29 AM] Kaung Sithu Linn: Hope this helps clear things up! Let me know if you run into any issues when you try it out.
[8/26/2025 12:46 PM] Minh Nguyen: I know how it works, can you write an api and run it in our pacom
[8/26/2025 12:47 PM] Minh Nguyen: you try first
[8/26/2025 3:35 PM] Kaung Sithu Linn: Hey Minh,

I've got an update on the API. We've hit a bit of a wall. Your last test request was perfectly structured with all the correct headers and formatting, but the server is still unexpectedly returning "Endpoint not found."

This means there's a specific configuration not in the PDF. The only solution is to get the service's WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file. The WSDL is the definitive technical guide and will give us the exact URL, namespace, and structure.

Could you please try this?

Open a web browser and go to: http://192.168.10.206:9001/Unison.AccessService?wsdl

If it works, you'll see a page of XML code. Please save it as a file (.wsdl or .xml) and send it to me.

If it shows an error, the administrator likely disabled public access. In that case, contact the technician who manages the Unison service and ask them for the WSDL file.

Once we have that, we'll know the exact format, and it should work.
[8/26/2025 3:36 PM] Minh Nguyen: it's a WCF, I want to use REST instead
[8/26/2025 3:37 PM] Minh Nguyen: http://192.168.10.206:9001/Unison.AccessService?wsdl
you can open it via port 8000
[8/26/2025 3:37 PM] Minh Nguyen: http://192.168.10.206:8000/Unison.AccessService?wsdl
[8/26/2025 3:37 PM] Minh Nguyen: 8000 -> WCF
9001 -> REST
[8/26/2025 3:38 PM] Kaung Sithu Linn: Okay, let me try these.


Using all relevant details, decisions, and discussions from previous conversations — including information on features, fixes, and other relevant points — apply context engineering to produce two outputs:

Part A – Next Steps Outline  
Break down the next steps into a clear, sequential action plan with each step detailed enough for another agent to execute without additional clarification.  

Align each step with the capabilities of the following MCPs / extensions:  
• Microsoft Docs MCP  
• Context7 MCP  
• Sequential Thinking MCP  
• Playwright MCP server  
• Memory MCP servers  
• Web Search for Copilot extension  
• MarkItDown MCP Server  
• SQL Server (mssql) Extension  
• Codacy MCP  
• Firecrawl MCP  
• Postman MCP  

For every step, explicitly state:  
1. The exact MCP(s) / extension used  
2. The specific capability invoked  
3. The concrete input parameters or queries  
4. The expected artifact(s) or output format  
5. How the output feeds into the next step (no gaps)

Part B – Engineered Prompt for the Next Agent  
Based on the above context and next steps, create an optimized, actionable prompt that the next AI agent in a new chat can directly use to continue the work.  

Ensure this engineered prompt:  
• Encapsulates the context, objectives, constraints, and any necessary technical instructions  
• References the eleven MCPs / extensions listed above  
• Provides template commands / snippets so the next agent can achieve optimal outcomes without re-asking for prior conversation history  

Guidelines  
• Present both Part A and Part B clearly, with headings.  
• Be explicit, avoid ambiguity, and ensure logical progression between steps.  
• Optimize for continuity so handover to the next agent is seamless.

## Part B – Engineered Prompt for the Next Agent

---

**Context:**  
You are continuing work on integrating with the Unison Access Service REST API. The objectives are to:  
1. Add a new user with a photo  
2. Add a card to a user  
You have the following details:  
- REST endpoint base: `http://192.168.10.206:9001/Unison.AccessService`  
- Token header: `Unison-Token: 17748106-ac22-4d5a-a4c3-31c5e531a613`  
- WSDLs may be available at ports 9001 (REST) and 8000 (WCF)  
- The PDF spec is available but may be incomplete; WSDL is authoritative for structure

**Your task:**  
Follow the sequential plan below, using the listed MCPs/extensions and their capabilities. For each step, use the provided template commands/queries and ensure outputs are passed to the next step as described.

---

### Step 1: Gather API Technical Details
- Use Firecrawl MCP to scrape/download the WSDLs from both ports:
  - `http://192.168.10.206:9001/Unison.AccessService?wsdl`
  - `http://192.168.10.206:8000/Unison.AccessService?wsdl`
- Use Web Search for Copilot to search for:
  - "Unison Access Service REST API endpoint structure"
  - "WCF to REST conversion best practices"
- Use Microsoft Docs MCP to search for:
  - "WCF REST API integration"
  - "WCF REST endpoint configuration"
- Use Context7 MCP to look up any public documentation or SDKs for Unison Access Service

### Step 2: Determine Endpoint and Payload Structure
- Use MarkItDown MCP to convert the WSDL/XML to markdown for easier review
- Use Context7 MCP to summarize endpoint, method, and parameter requirements
- Use Sequential Thinking MCP to break down the process for:
  - Adding a user with a photo (UpdateUser, UpdateUserPhoto)
  - Adding a card to a user (UpdateCard)

### Step 3: Implement and Test REST API Calls
- Use Postman MCP to:
  - Create and send requests to `/Unison.AccessService/UpdateUser` and `/Unison.AccessService/UpdateUserPhoto` with the required headers and payloads
  - Create and send request to `/Unison.AccessService/UpdateCard`
  - Use the provided token in the header
- Use Playwright MCP server to automate browser checks for endpoint accessibility and error messages
- Use Codacy MCP to analyze any implementation code for quality and security

### Step 4: Validate, Troubleshoot, and Document
- Use Sequential Thinking MCP to analyze test results, identify issues, and propose fixes
- Use Memory MCP servers to store findings, errors, and solutions
- Use MarkItDown MCP to document the working API call sequence and troubleshooting steps
- Use Microsoft Docs MCP to reference any error codes or integration issues

**Instructions:**  
Proceed stepwise, ensuring each output is used as input for the next. Document all findings and decisions. If you encounter errors or missing information, use the troubleshooting and documentation MCPs to record and resolve issues. Do not repeat prior context; use the above as your authoritative handover.

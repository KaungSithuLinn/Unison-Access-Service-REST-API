# SOAP Service Validation and Documentation Plan (2025-09-12 07:13Z)

_**User (2025-09-12 07:14Z)**_

**Concise, Structured Summary of Current Chat**

**Background**: Unison Access Service is a SOAP service (confirmed via WSDL analysis) but was miscommunicated as REST.  
**Key Discussions**:  
- Technical confirmation: Only `basicHttpBinding` and `mexHttpBinding` present (SOAP 1.1)  
- Stakeholder alignment: Minh uses "REST" colloquially for HTTP-accessible services  
- Solution: REST-to-SOAP adapter is correct implementation  
**Evidence Plan**:  
- Execute `curl` tests to demonstrate SOAP requirements  
- Document results in `docs/soap-vs-rest-evidence.md`  
**Next Actions**: Stakeholder education, adapter validation, documentation update  
**Blockers**: None – technical implementation is correct  
**Open Questions**: None  

---

### PART A – Next-Steps Outline  

#### Global Tool-Set  
- **MCPs/extensions**: Microsoft-Docs, Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Playwright, Memory, Web-Search-for-Copilot, MarkItDown, SQL-Server(mssql), Codacy, Firecrawl, Postman, HashiCorp Terraform MCP, GitHub MCP, GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension  
- **Built-ins**: workspace file search & read, `specify` CLI, `git`, `gh`, `terraform`, `codacy-cli`, `curl`  

#### Mandatory Entry Step – Summarise & Sync  
| # | Tool / Built-in | Capability | Input | Output | Next |  
|---|-----------------|------------|-------|--------|------|  
| 0.1 | built-in | `summarise_current_chat` | Full transcript → structured summary | `chat_summary.md` | 0.2 |  
| 0.2 | built-in | `update_spec_kit_files` | Merge `chat_summary.md` into `specs/latest/spec.md` | Updated spec | 0.3 |  
| 0.3 | GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension | `commit_push` | Message = `"spec: sync soap-rest-clarification"` | Remote updated | 0.4 |  
| 0.4 | Memory MCP | `store_snapshot` | `{"source":"chat_summary.md","phase":"Clarification"}` | Memory updated | Phase 1 |  

#### Phase 1 – Evidence Gathering & Documentation  
1. **Execute Validation Tests**:  
   - Use **Postman** or `curl` to send JSON payload → confirm failure  
   - Send valid SOAP envelope → confirm success  
   - Capture responses in `docs/soap-vs-rest-evidence.md`  

2. **Update Documentation**:  
   - Add service architecture explanation to `docs/architecture.md`  
   - Clarify REST adapter purpose in `README.md`  

3. **Stakeholder Communication**:  
   - Draft message to Minh with evidence summary  
   - Schedule alignment call using **Microsoft-Docs** for notes  

---

### PART B – Engineered Prompt for the Next Agent  

```
You are continuing a Spec-Kit-driven project.  
Your tool-set: the 14 MCPs/extensions listed above + workspace file access + `specify` CLI.

START-UP CHECKLIST  
1. Pull latest: `git pull origin main`  
2. Read `chat_summary.md` → confirms SOAP service nature and communication plan  
3. Read `specs/latest/spec.md` → verify adapter implementation is correct  
4. Check `memory/current_phase.json` → phase = "Clarification"

CURRENT PHASE INSTRUCTIONS  
- Execute validation tests (JSON vs SOAP calls)  
- Document evidence in `docs/soap-vs-rest-evidence.md`  
- Draft stakeholder communication with findings  
- Update project documentation to clarify architecture

HAND-OVER REPORT  
Before finishing:  
a. Re-run Steps 0.1-0.4 (summarise, update spec, commit & push, memory store)  
b. Print markdown block with:  
   - Phase completed  
   - Artifacts changed (paths + hashes)  
   - Next agent's entry command  
   - Remaining risks/blockers
```

**Current Phase Marker**: `"Clarification"`  
**Entry Command**: Execute validation tests and document SOAP/REST evidence  
**Note**: Primary implementation is correct; focus on evidence gathering and stakeholder alignment  

**Expected Output**: Documented proof of SOAP service requirements, updated documentation, and stakeholder communication draft.

_**Assistant**_

Here’s a concise, structured summary and actionable next-steps plan for the current phase (“Clarification”) of your Unison Access Service project:

---

## Summary

- **Service Type**: Confirmed SOAP (via WSDL, only `basicHttpBinding`/`mexHttpBinding`)
- **Miscommunication**: “REST” used colloquially for HTTP-accessible services
- **Correct Solution**: REST-to-SOAP adapter is the right approach
- **Evidence Plan**: Run `curl` tests (JSON fails, SOAP succeeds), document in `docs/soap-vs-rest-evidence.md`
- **Next Actions**: Gather evidence, update documentation, draft stakeholder communication

---

## Next-Steps Outline

### 0. Mandatory Entry Step – Summarise & Sync
1. Summarise current chat → `chat_summary.md`
2. Merge summary into spec → `spec.md`
3. Commit & push: `"spec: sync soap-rest-clarification"`
4. Store snapshot in memory (`current_phase.json`)

### 1. Evidence Gathering & Documentation
- Run `curl` with JSON payload (expect failure)
- Run `curl` with SOAP envelope (expect success)
- Save both commands and responses in `docs/soap-vs-rest-evidence.md`

### 2. Documentation Update
- Add architecture explanation to `docs/architecture.md`
- Clarify REST adapter in `README.md`

### 3. Stakeholder Communication
- Draft message to Minh summarizing findings and evidence
- Optionally, schedule alignment call and prepare notes

### 4. Handover Protocol
- Re-run steps 0.1–0.4 (summarise, update spec, commit, memory store)
- Print markdown block with:
  - Phase completed
  - Artifacts changed (paths + hashes)
  - Next agent’s entry command
  - Remaining risks/blockers

---

**You are ready to proceed with validation tests, documentation, and stakeholder communication as described.**

---

_**User (2025-09-12 07:14Z)**_

So what shoulde we do next?

---

_**Assistant**_

The next steps are:

1. Summarize the current chat and sync project documentation (per project rules).
2. Run validation tests:
   - Use curl to call the service with a JSON payload (expect failure).
   - Use curl to call the service with a SOAP envelope (expect success).
   - Save both commands and responses in docs/soap-vs-rest-evidence.md.
3. Update documentation:
   - Add a service architecture explanation to docs/architecture.md.
   - Clarify the REST adapter’s purpose in README.md.
4. Draft a stakeholder communication message summarizing findings and evidence.
5. Re-run the summarization and sync steps, then print a handover report.

I will start by creating a structured todo list for these steps. Here’s what we should do next (in order):

1. Summarize and sync project documentation (current chat → chat_summary.md, update spec, commit, store snapshot).
2. Run validation tests and document evidence (curl with JSON and SOAP, save results in docs/soap-vs-rest-evidence.md).
3. Update project documentation (add architecture explanation and clarify REST adapter in docs/architecture.md and README.md).
4. Draft a stakeholder communication message summarizing findings and evidence.
5. Re-run summarization and print a handover report.

I am starting with step 1: summarizing and syncing the project documentation.

   - Capture both commands and responses in `docs/soap-vs-rest-evidence.md` using **MarkItDown**  

2. **Update Documentation**:  
   - Add service architecture explanation to `docs/architecture.md` using **MarkItDown**  
   - Clarify REST adapter purpose in `README.md` using **MarkItDown**  

3. **Stakeholder Communication**:

### PART B – Engineered Prompt for the Next Agent  

```
You are continuing a Spec-Kit-driven project.  
Your tool-set: the 14 MCPs/extensions listed above + workspace file access + `specify` CLI.

START-UP CHECKLIST  
1. Pull latest: `git pull origin main`  
2. Read `chat_summary.md` (root) → confirms SOAP service nature and communication plan  
3. Read `specs/latest/spec.md` → verify adapter implementation is correct  
4. Continue from the phase marker inside `memory/current_phase.json` (should be "Clarification")

CURRENT PHASE INSTRUCTIONS  
- Phase marker = "Clarification" → execute validation tests and document evidence  
- Use `curl` or Postman for testing:  
  - JSON call: expect failure  
  - SOAP call: expect success  
- Document results in `docs/soap-vs-rest-evidence.md`  
- Update `docs/architecture.md` and `README.md` with architecture clarity  
- Draft stakeholder communication (Minh) with findings  
- Re-run Mandatory Entry Step (0.1-0.4) after completion

HAND-OVER REPORT  
Before you finish, ALWAYS:  
a. Re-run Step 0.1-0.4 (summarise, update Spec-Kit files, commit & push with GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension, memory store).  
b. Print a markdown block with:  
   - Phase completed  
   - Artifacts changed (paths + hashes)  
   - Next agent’s entry command  
   - Remaining risks / blockers
```

**Current Phase Marker**: `"Clarification"`  
**Entry Command**: Execute validation tests and document SOAP/REST evidence  
**Note**: Focus on evidence gathering, documentation updates, and stakeholder alignment. The REST-to-SOAP adapter is already implemented and correct.  

**Expected Output**: Documented proof of SOAP service requirements, updated documentation, and stakeholder communication draft.

_**Assistant**_

The next step is to execute the "Mandatory Entry Step – Summarise & Sync" as outlined in your project rules. This ensures all documentation and project state are up to date before proceeding with evidence gathering and documentation updates.

Here’s what I will do now:
1. Summarize the current chat and update `chat_summary.md`.
2. Merge the summary into `spec.md`.
3. Commit and push with the message: "spec: sync soap-rest-clarification".
4. Store a snapshot in memory with phase = "Clarification".

After this, I will proceed to the validation tests and documentation steps. Let’s begin with step 1.
The correct next action is to perform the "Mandatory Entry Step – Summarise & Sync" (steps 0.1–0.4):

1. Summarize the current chat and update `chat_summary.md`.
2. Merge the summary into `spec.md`.
3. Commit and push with the message: "spec: sync soap-rest-clarification".
4. Store a snapshot in memory with phase = "Clarification".

Once this is done, proceed to validation tests and documentation updates as described in your outline. I will start with step 1 now.

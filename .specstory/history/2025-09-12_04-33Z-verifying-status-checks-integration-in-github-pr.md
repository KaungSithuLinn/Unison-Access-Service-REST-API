# Verifying Status Checks Integration in GitHub PR (2025-09-12 04:33Z)

_**User (2025-09-12 05:23Z)**_

### Concise, Structured Summary of Current Chat

**Background**: Unison Access Service REST API project with completed implementation but initially unprotected main branch.  
**Key Events**:  
- All 7 enhancement issues implemented and PRs created (#8-#14)  
- Security vulnerabilities resolved and infrastructure setup completed  
- Main branch protection configured via GitHub UI but status checks pending CI run  
- CI workflows triggered successfully, generating status checks (`ci/application` and `ci/infrastructure`)  
- Repository divergence identified between original parent folder and current subfolder locations  
**Current State**:  
- Codebase: Production-ready with all features implemented  
- Security: Branch protection ruleset configured; status checks available but not yet integrated into ruleset  
- Repository: Current subfolder repo (`Unison-Access-Service-REST-API`) is canonical with up-to-date `main` branch; original parent folder repo has older `main` branch and additional feature branches  
**Decisions**:  
- Current subfolder repo designated as canonical base  
- Proceed with test PR to verify status check integration  
**Features**: All technical implementations complete; protection configured awaiting final status check integration  
**Fixes**: CI workflows executed successfully; status checks now available  
**Blockers**: None  
**Open Questions**: Need to migrate any unique changes from original repo's feature branches?

### PART A – Next-Steps Outline  

#### Global Tool-Set  
- **MCPs / extensions**: Microsoft-Docs, Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Playwright, Memory, Web-Search-for-Copilot, MarkItDown, SQL-Server(mssql), Codacy, Firecrawl, Postman, HashiCorp Terraform MCP, GitHub MCP, GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension  
- **Built-ins**: workspace file search & read, `specify` CLI, `git`, `gh`, `terraform`, `codacy-cli`  

#### Mandatory Entry Step – Summarise & Sync  
| # | Tool / Built-in | Capability | Input | Output | Next |  
|---|-----------------|------------|-------|--------|------|  
| 0.1 | built-in | `summarise_current_chat` | Full transcript → structured summary | `chat_summary.md` | 0.2 |  
| 0.2 | built-in | `update_spec_kit_files` | Merge `chat_summary.md` into `specs/latest/spec.md` & `tasks.json` | Updated Spec-Kit artifacts | 0.3 |  
| 0.3 | GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension | `commit_push` | Message = `"spec: sync test-verify-status-checks"` | Remote branch updated | 0.4 |  
| 0.4 | Memory MCP | `store_snapshot` | `{"source":"chat_summary.md","phase":"Test-Verify"}` | Memory updated | Phase 1 |  

#### Phase 1 – Test & Verify Status Checks (Spec-Kit Gate ⑧)  
1. **Commit Current Changes**:  
   - Use **GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension** to commit all uncommitted changes in canonical repo  
   - Command: `git add . && git commit -m "chore: commit pending changes for test"`  

2. **Create Test PR**:  
   - Use **GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension** to create test PR from feature branch to main  
   - Command: `gh pr create --title "Test Status Checks Integration" --body "Verify status checks block merge until passed" --head test-branch --base main`  

3. **Verify Protection Rules**:  
   - Use **GitHub MCP** to confirm PR requires status checks and approvals  
   - Check: PR cannot be merged until `ci/application` and `ci/infrastructure` checks pass  

4. **Clean Up Test Resources**:  
   - Use **GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension** to close PR and delete test branch after verification  

5. **Documentation Update**:  
   - Use **MarkItDown MCP** to update protection documentation with verification results  
   - File: `docs/security/branch-protection.md`  

#### Phase 2 – Repository Consolidation (Optional)  
1. **Migrate Unique Changes**:  
   - Use **GitHub MCP** to check for unique commits in original repo's feature branches  
   - Command: `git log --oneline --graph --all --max-count=10` in both repos  

2. **Merge or Rebase**:  
   - Use **GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension** to integrate any unique changes into canonical repo  

3. **Clean Up Old Repo**:  
   - Archive or delete original parent folder repo to avoid confusion

### PART B – Engineered Prompt for the Next Agent  

```
You are continuing a Spec-Kit-driven project.  
Your tool-set: the 14 MCPs/extensions listed above + workspace file access + `specify` CLI.

START-UP CHECKLIST  
1. Pull latest: `git pull origin main`  
2. Read `chat_summary.md` (root) → confirms status checks available and need for test verification  
3. Read `specs/latest/spec.md` → confirms all implementations complete; need test PR for status checks  
4. Continue from the phase marker inside `memory/current_phase.json`.

CURRENT PHASE INSTRUCTIONS  
- Phase marker = `"Test-Verify"` → create test PR to verify status checks integration  
- Use GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension to commit any pending changes: `git add . && git commit -m "chore: commit pending changes for test"`  
- Create test branch and PR: `git checkout -b test-status-verify && echo "test" > test-file.md && git add . && git commit -m "test: verify status checks" && git push origin test-status-verify && gh pr create --title "Test Status Checks" --body "Verifying that status checks block merge" --head test-status-verify --base main`  
- Verify PR shows required status checks and cannot be merged until they pass  
- Close PR and delete branch after verification: `gh pr close <number> && git push origin --delete test-status-verify`  
- Update documentation: Add verification results to `docs/security/branch-protection.md`

HAND-OVER REPORT  
Before you finish, ALWAYS:  
a. Re-run Step 0.1-0.4 (summarise, update Spec-Kit files, commit & push with GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension, memory store).  
b. Print a markdown block with:  
   - Phase completed  
   - Artifacts changed (paths + hashes)  
   - Next agent’s entry command  
   - Remaining risks / blockers
```

**Current Phase Marker**: `"Test-Verify"`  
**Entry Command**: Create test PR to verify status checks integration and confirm merge blocking until checks pass.  
**Note**: Status checks `ci/application` and `ci/infrastructure` are available from CI runs. Test PR must demonstrate that merge is blocked until these checks pass. This is the final verification step for production-grade branch protection.  

**Expected Output**: Verified branch protection with status checks enforcing merge requirements, updated documentation, and clean repository state.

_**Assistant**_

**Phase: Test-Verify**  
Starting with Step 0.1: Summarise & sync Spec-Kit artifacts (summarise current chat, update `chat_summary.md`, merge into `spec.md`, commit & push, store snapshot in memory).

I will proceed step by step through the outlined plan, updating you as each phase is completed.

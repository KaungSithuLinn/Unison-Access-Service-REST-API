### Concise, Structured Summary of Current Chat

**Background**: Unison Access Service REST API project with completed implementation and branch protection configuration.  
**Key Events**:  
- GitHub CLI installed and authenticated successfully  
- Test PR (#15) created and verified status checks enforcement  
- Status checks (`ci/application` and `ci/infrastructure`) confirmed to block merging until passed  
- Branch protection documentation updated with verification results  
**Current State**:  
- Codebase: Production-ready with all features implemented  
- Security: Branch protection fully configured and verified  
- Repository: Test resources cleaned up (PR closed, branch deleted)  
**Decisions**: Branch protection implementation is complete and verified  
**Features**: All technical implementations complete; protection verified  
**Fixes**: Status check integration verified and documented  
**Blockers**: None  
**Open Questions**: None

### PART A – Next-Steps Outline  

#### Global Tool-Set  
- **MCPs / extensions**: Microsoft-Docs, Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Playwright, Memory, Web-Search-for-Copilot, MarkItDown, SQL-Server(mssql), Codacy, Firecrawl, Postman, HashiCorp Terraform MCP, GitHub MCP, GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension  
- **Built-ins**: workspace file search & read, `specify` CLI, `git`, `gh`, `terraform`, `codacy-cli`  

#### Mandatory Entry Step – Summarise & Sync  
| # | Tool / Built-in | Capability | Input | Output | Next |  
|---|-----------------|------------|-------|--------|------|  
| 0.1 | built-in | `summarise_current_chat` | Full transcript → structured summary | `chat_summary.md` | 0.2 |  
| 0.2 | built-in | `update_spec_kit_files` | Merge `chat_summary.md` into `specs/latest/spec.md` & `tasks.json` | Updated Spec-Kit artifacts | 0.3 |  
| 0.3 | GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension | `commit_push` | Message = `"spec: sync branch-protection-complete"` | Remote branch updated | 0.4 |  
| 0.4 | Memory MCP | `store_snapshot` | `{"source":"chat_summary.md","phase":"Complete"}` | Memory updated | Handoff |  

#### Phase 1 – Repository Consolidation (Optional)  
1. **Compare Repositories**:  
   - Use **GitHub MCP** to compare original and canonical repositories  
   - Command: `git -C "C:\Projects\Unison Access Service REST API" log --oneline --graph --all --max-count=20`  

2. **Migrate Unique Changes**:  
   - Use **GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension** to cherry-pick any unique commits  
   - Create PRs for any valuable changes from original repo  

3. **Clean Up**:  
   - Archive or delete original parent folder repo to avoid confusion

### PART B – Engineered Prompt for the Next Agent  

```
You are continuing a Spec-Kit-driven project.  
Your tool-set: the 14 MCPs/extensions listed above + workspace file access + `specify` CLI.

START-UP CHECKLIST  
1. Pull latest: `git pull origin main`  
2. Read `chat_summary.md` (root) → confirms branch protection complete and verified  
3. Read `specs/latest/spec.md` → confirms all implementations complete  
4. Continue from the phase marker inside `memory/current_phase.json`.

CURRENT PHASE INSTRUCTIONS  
- Phase marker = `"Complete"` → project implementation is finished  
- Optional: Perform repository consolidation if needed  
- Verify all documentation is up to date  
- Ensure all security measures are properly configured  

HAND-OVER REPORT  
Before you finish, ALWAYS:  
a. Re-run Step 0.1-0.4 (summarise, update Spec-Kit files, commit & push with GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension, memory store).  
b. Print a markdown block with:  
   - Phase completed  
   - Artifacts changed (paths + hashes)  
   - Next agent's entry command  
   - Remaining risks / blockers
```

**Current Phase Marker**: `"Complete"`  
**Entry Command**: Verify project completion and perform optional repository consolidation.  
**Note**: The main branch protection is fully implemented and verified. All features are complete. Optional repository consolidation can be performed if there are valuable changes in the original repository.  

**Expected Output**: Fully protected production-ready repository with complete documentation and optional repository consolidation.

_**Assistant**_

I'll execute the mandatory Summarise & Sync process as outlined in the instructions. Let me start with the todo list to track this structured handover process. Now let me begin with the mandatory entry step process. First, I'll mark the first todo as in-progress and create the structured chat summary.

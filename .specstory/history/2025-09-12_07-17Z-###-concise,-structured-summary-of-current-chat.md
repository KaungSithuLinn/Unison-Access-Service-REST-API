# ### Concise, Structured Summary of Current Chat (2025-09-12 07:17Z)

### Concise, Structured Summary of Current Chat

**Background**: Unison Access Service is a SOAP service (confirmed via WSDL analysis) but was miscommunicated as REST.  
**Key Discussions**:  
- Technical confirmation: Only `basicHttpBinding` and `mexHttpBinding` present (SOAP 1.1)  
- Stakeholder alignment: Minh uses "REST" colloquially for HTTP-accessible services  
- Solution: REST-to-SOAP adapter is correct implementation  
**Evidence Plan**:  
- Execute `curl` tests to demonstrate SOAP requirements  
- Document results in `docs/soap-vs-rest-evidence.md`  
**Next Actions**: Stakeholder education, adapter validation, documentation update  
**Blockers**: None – technical implementation is correct  
**Open Questions**: None

### PART A – Next-Steps Outline  

#### Global Tool-Set  
- **MCPs / extensions**: Microsoft-Docs, Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Playwright, Memory, Web-Search-for-Copilot, MarkItDown, SQL-Server(mssql), Codacy, Firecrawl, Postman, HashiCorp Terraform MCP, GitHub MCP, GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension  
- **Built-ins**: workspace file search & read, `specify` CLI, `git`, `gh`, `terraform`, `codacy-cli`, `curl`  

#### Mandatory Entry Step – Summarise & Sync  
| # | Tool / Built-in | Capability | Input | Output | Next |  
|---|-----------------|------------|-------|--------|------|  
| 0.1 | built-in | `summarise_current_chat` | Full transcript → structured summary | `chat_summary.md` | 0.2 |  
| 0.2 | built-in | `update_spec_kit_files` | Merge `chat_summary.md` into `specs/latest/spec.md` & `tasks.json` | Updated Spec-Kit artifacts | 0.3 |  
| 0.3 | GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension | `commit & push` | Message = `"spec: sync soap-rest-clarification"` | Remote branch updated | 0.4 |  
| 0.4 | Memory MCP | `store_snapshot` | `{"source":"chat_summary.md","phase":"Clarification"}` | Memory updated | Phase 1 |  

#### Phase 1 – Clarification (Evidence Gathering & Documentation)  
1. **Execute Validation Tests**:  
   - Use `curl` or **Postman** to send JSON payload to `http://192.168.10.206:9003/Unison.AccessService` → confirm failure (e.g., HTTP 415/400)  
   - Use `curl` or **Postman** to send valid SOAP envelope with correct SOAPAction header → confirm success or meaningful SOAP response  
   - Capture both commands and responses in `docs/soap-vs-rest-evidence.md` using **MarkItDown**  

2. **Update Documentation**:  
   - Add service architecture explanation to `docs/architecture.md` using **MarkItDown**  
   - Clarify REST adapter purpose in `README.md` using **MarkItDown**  

3. **Stakeholder Communication**:  
   - Draft message to Minh with evidence summary using **Microsoft-Docs**  
   - Schedule alignment call and prepare notes using **Microsoft-Docs**  

4. **Handover Preparation**:  
   - Re-run Mandatory Entry Step (0.1-0.4) to sync latest state  
   - Generate handover report per PART B

### PART B – Engineered Prompt for the Next Agent  

```
You are continuing a Spec-Kit-driven project.  
Your tool-set: the 14 MCPs/extensions listed above + workspace file access + `specify` CLI.

START-UP CHECKLIST  
1. Pull latest: `git pull origin main`  
2. Read `chat_summary.md` (root) → confirms SOAP service nature and communication plan  
3. Read `specs/latest/spec.md` → verify adapter implementation is correct  
4. Continue from the phase marker inside `memory/current_phase.json` (should be "Clarification")

CURRENT PHASE INSTRUCTIONS  
- Phase marker = "Clarification" → execute validation tests and document evidence  
- Use `curl` or Postman for testing:  
  - JSON call: expect failure  
  - SOAP call: expect success  
- Document results in `docs/soap-vs-rest-evidence.md`  
- Update `docs/architecture.md` and `README.md` with architecture clarity  
- Draft stakeholder communication (Minh) with findings  
- Re-run Mandatory Entry Step (0.1-0.4) after completion

HAND-OVER REPORT  
Before you finish, ALWAYS:  
a. Re-run Step 0.1-0.4 (summarise, update Spec-Kit files, commit & push with GitHub Pull Requests & Issues extension, memory store).  
b. Print a markdown block with:  
   - Phase completed  
   - Artifacts changed (paths + hashes)  
   - Next agent’s entry command  
   - Remaining risks / blockers
```

**Current Phase Marker**: `"Clarification"`  
**Entry Command**: Execute validation tests and document SOAP/REST evidence  
**Note**: Focus on evidence gathering, documentation updates, and stakeholder alignment. The REST-to-SOAP adapter is already implemented and correct.  

**Expected Output**: Documented proof of SOAP service requirements, updated documentation, and stakeholder communication draft.

_**Assistant**_

I'll begin by executing the mandatory entry step to summarize and sync the current state, then proceed with the clarification phase as outlined.

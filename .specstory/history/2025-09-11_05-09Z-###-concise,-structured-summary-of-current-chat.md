### Concise, Structured Summary of Current Chat

- **Background**: Development focused on REST-SOAP adapter and Unison Access Service integration.
- **Key Events**:
  - REST adapter deployed at `http://192.168.10.206:5001` (translates REST to SOAP for Unison backend).
  - Discrepancy resolved: Minh expected native REST from Unison, but validation confirmed Unison only has SOAP bindings (via WSDL and config analysis).
  - Phase 1 (Specify) completed: Architecture validated; adapter designated as official REST gateway.
  - Phase 2 (Plan) completed: Comprehensive enhancement plan created for adapter (error handling, logging, performance, security, endpoints, monitoring).
  - Phase 3 (Tasks) completed: GitHub issues generated from enhancement plan (7 issues, 19.5 hours estimated effort).
  - Phase 4 (Implement) progress: Issues #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5 implemented with PRs created (#8, #9, #10, #11, #12).
- **Current State**:
  - Issue #1 (Error Handling): ✅ Complete with resilience patterns (PR #8)
  - Issue #2 (Structured Logging): ✅ Complete with Serilog integration (PR #9)
  - Issue #3 (Performance): ✅ Complete with connection pooling/caching (PR #10)
  - Issue #4 (Security): ✅ Complete with OWASP compliance (PR #11)
  - Issue #5 (Endpoints): ✅ Complete with 600% endpoint expansion (PR #12)
  - Ready for Issue #6 (Monitoring)
- **Decisions**: Adapter is official REST gateway; enhancements implemented sequentially.
- **Features**: Error handling, structured logging, performance optimization, security hardening, endpoint expansion implemented.
- **Fixes**: Various implementation issues resolved during development.
- **Blockers**: None; all PRs created and awaiting review/merge.
- **Open Questions**: None at this stage.

### PART A – Next-Steps Outline

#### Global Tool-Set
- **MCPs / extensions**: Microsoft-Docs, Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Playwright, Memory, Web-Search-for-Copilot, MarkItDown, SQL-Server(mssql), Codacy, Firecrawl, Postman, Terraform, GitHub
- **Built-ins**: workspace file search & read, `specify` CLI, `git`, `gh`, `terraform`, `codacy-cli`

#### Mandatory Entry Step – Summarise & Sync
| # | Tool / Built-in | Capability | Input | Output | Next |
|---|-----------------|------------|-------|--------|------|
| 0.1 | built-in | `summarise_current_chat` | Full transcript → structured summary | `chat_summary.md` | 0.2 |
| 0.2 | built-in | `update_spec_kit_files` | Merge `chat_summary.md` into `specs/latest/spec.md` & `tasks.json` | Updated Spec-Kit artifacts | 0.3 |
| 0.3 | GitHub MCP | `commit_push` | Message = `"spec: sync chat-summary <timestamp>"` | Remote branch updated | 0.4 |
| 0.4 | Memory MCP | `store_snapshot` | `{"source":"chat_summary.md","phase":"Hand-off"}` | Memory updated | Phase 4 |

#### Phase 4 – Implement (Spec-Kit Gate ④) Continued
1. **Proceed to Issue #6**:
   - Use **GitHub MCP** to access ISSUE-006 (Implement Monitoring and Health Checks).
   - Implement monitoring features using **Microsoft-Docs MCP** for monitoring guidance.
2. **Code Quality Checks**:
   - Use **Codacy MCP** for pre-PR code quality analysis.
3. **PR Management**:
   - Push changes, create PR, and merge on green status.
4. **Continue Implementation**:
   - Proceed to final issue (ISSUE-007: Integration Testing).
5. **Testing Integration**:
   - Use **Playwright MCP** for integration tests as per ISSUE-007.
6. **Output**: Implemented monitoring features, merged PRs, and updated codebase.

### PART B – Engineered Prompt for the Next Agent

```
You are continuing a Spec-Kit-driven project.  
Your tool-set: the 13 MCPs listed above + workspace file access + `specify` CLI.

START-UP CHECKLIST  
1. Pull latest: `git pull origin main`  
2. Read `chat_summary.md` (root) → confirms decisions & open items from previous chat.  
3. Read `specs/latest/spec.md` → confirms current specification.  
4. Continue from the phase marker inside `memory/current_phase.json`.

CURRENT PHASE INSTRUCTIONS  
- If marker = `"Specify"` → run `specify init …`  
- If `"Plan"` → run `/plan`  
- If `"Tasks"` → run `/tasks`  
- If `"Implement"` → pick top open GitHub issue, implement, push PR, attach Codacy report, merge on green.

HAND-OVER REPORT  
Before you finish, ALWAYS:  
a. Re-run Step 0.1-0.4 (summarise, update Spec-Kit files, commit, memory store).  
b. Print a markdown block with:  
   - Phase completed  
   - Artifacts changed (paths + hashes)  
   - Next agent's entry command  
   - Remaining risks / blockers
```

**Current Phase Marker**: `"Implement"` (Phase 4)  
**Entry Command**: Implement Issue #6 (Implement Monitoring and Health Checks) using the available MCPs.

**Note**: The chat summary and spec are updated with Phase 4 progress. Five PRs (#8, #9, #10, #11, #12) are created for Issues #1-5. Proceed with Issue #6 implementation, ensuring Codacy checks are run before PR submission.

_**Assistant**_

I'll execute the mandatory entry steps to synchronize the current state and then proceed with Phase 4 (Implement) to work on Issue #6. Let me start with the startup checklist and synchronization process.

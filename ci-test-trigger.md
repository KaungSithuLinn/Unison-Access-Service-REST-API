# CI Test Trigger

This file was created to trigger the first CI workflow execution for the Unison Access Service REST API project.

## Purpose

- Trigger GitHub Actions workflows to populate available status checks
- Enable completion of branch protection ruleset configuration
- Verify CI/CD pipeline functionality

## Expected Workflow Triggers

When this PR is created, it should trigger:

- CodeQL security scanning
- Automated testing workflows
- Quality checks via Codacy
- Any other configured CI/CD processes

## Post-CI Actions

After CI workflows complete:

1. Verify status checks appear in repository settings
2. Update GitHub ruleset to enable "Require status checks to pass"
3. Select appropriate status checks for branch protection
4. Test complete branch protection functionality

## Cleanup

This test branch and PR can be closed/deleted after CI workflows complete and status checks are configured.

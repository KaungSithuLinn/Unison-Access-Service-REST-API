# TASK-009 CI/CD Pipeline Setup - COMPLETION REPORT

**Date:** January 7, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Priority:** High  
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot

## üìã TASK SUMMARY

**Original Request:** Set up automated CI/CD pipelines for build, test, and deployment automation

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- ‚úÖ Automated build on code changes
- ‚úÖ Test execution in pipeline
- ‚úÖ Automated deployment to staging
- ‚úÖ Manual approval for production

## üèóÔ∏è IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW

### Core Pipeline Components Created

#### 1. Azure DevOps Pipeline (`azure-pipelines.yml`)

```yaml
# 6-Stage Pipeline Architecture
stages:
  - Build # .NET build and test
  - Security # Codacy quality scanning
  - Publish # Artifact publishing
  - Deploy_Staging # Automated staging deployment
  - Deploy_Prod # Manual approval + production deployment
  - Notify # Deployment notifications
```

**Key Features:**

- Multi-stage pipeline with environment separation
- Automated build triggers on main branch changes
- Comprehensive test execution (unit, integration, API)
- Security scanning integration with Codacy
- Artifact publishing to Azure DevOps
- Environment-specific variable groups
- Automated health checks and rollback procedures
- Slack/Teams notification integration

#### 2. GitHub Actions Enhancement (`.github/workflows/`)

**Enhanced CI Workflow (`ci.yml`):**

- Automated triggers on push/PR to main
- Multi-OS build matrix (ubuntu, windows)
- .NET 9.0 build and test execution
- Codacy quality scanning integration
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Artifact uploading

**New CD Workflow (`cd.yml`):**

- Manual deployment triggers via workflow_dispatch
- Environment-specific deployment (dev/staging/production)
- Docker build and deployment simulation
- Comprehensive health checks
- Manual approval gates for production

#### 3. Docker Containerization (`Dockerfile`)

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for optimized deployment
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0 AS build
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:9.0 AS runtime
```

**Security Features:**

- Non-root user execution
- Minimal attack surface
- Health check implementation
- Optimized layering for caching
- Security hardening best practices

#### 4. Multi-Environment Support (`docker-compose.yml`)

- Development environment configuration
- Staging environment setup
- Production environment template
- Nginx reverse proxy configuration
- Environment-specific health checks

#### 5. Deployment Automation (`Deploy-Automation.ps1`)

**Comprehensive PowerShell deployment script:**

- Multi-environment support (dev/staging/production)
- Multiple deployment types (Windows Service, Docker, IIS)
- Automated backup and rollback capabilities
- Health check validation
- Configuration management
- Logging and audit trail
- Manual approval workflows for production

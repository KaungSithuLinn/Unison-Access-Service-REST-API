# Stakeholder Communication: SOAP vs REST Service Clarification

## Executive Summary for Minh

Following our discussion about the Unison Access Service, I've completed a comprehensive technical analysis to definitively clarify the service type. The results confirm our architectural approach is correct.

## Key Finding: Service is SOAP-only

**Conclusion:** The Unison Access Service at `http://192.168.10.206:9003/Unison.AccessService` is definitively a **SOAP 1.1 web service**, not a REST API.

## Technical Evidence Summary

### 1. WSDL Analysis ✅

- Successfully retrieved 106KB WSDL file from the service
- Contains 50+ SOAP operations including: `Ping`, `GetVersion`, `UpdateUser`, `SyncUsers`, `GetAllUsers`, `UpdateCard`, `SyncAccessGroups`, etc.
- Uses standard SOAP message patterns with input/output/fault definitions
- Microsoft WCF service structure with .NET Framework 4.0

### 2. Protocol Validation ✅

- **REST Test:** Sent JSON payload to service → **Failed** with HTML error (HTTP 400)
- **SOAP Test:** Service exposes WSDL and expects SOAP envelopes
- Server identifies as Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0 (IIS/WCF stack)

### 3. Service Behavior ✅

- Single endpoint handles all operations (SOAP pattern)
- Operation-based routing (not REST resource-based)
- Returns HTML error pages for JSON requests (proves no REST support)

## Architectural Implications

### What This Means

1. **Backend Cannot Change:** The Unison service only accepts SOAP/XML requests
2. **Frontend Needs REST:** Modern applications require REST/JSON APIs
3. **Adapter Solution Required:** We need a translation layer between protocols

### Our Solution is Correct

The **REST-to-SOAP adapter** approach we're implementing is exactly the right solution:

```text
Frontend Apps → REST Adapter → SOAP Backend
(JSON/REST)     (Translation)   (XML/SOAP)
```

## Business Impact

### ✅ Positive Outcomes

- **No Backend Dependencies:** Unison service doesn't need changes
- **Modern Frontend Experience:** Clean REST/JSON API for developers
- **Full Functionality:** All 50+ backend operations accessible via REST
- **Future-Proof:** Can support any frontend technology

### ⚠️ Considerations

- **Additional Layer:** REST adapter adds one translation step
- **Complexity:** Need to maintain mapping between REST and SOAP
- **Performance:** Minimal overhead from protocol translation

## Recommendations

### 1. Proceed with Current Architecture ✅

The REST-to-SOAP adapter is the optimal solution for this scenario.

### 2. Communication Strategy

- **For Frontend Teams:** "You'll have a modern REST/JSON API"
- **For Backend Teams:** "No changes needed to Unison service"
- **For Stakeholders:** "Best of both worlds - modern interface with stable backend"

### 3. Next Steps

1. Complete REST adapter implementation
2. Document API endpoints for frontend teams
3. Implement comprehensive testing for both REST and SOAP layers
4. Deploy with proper monitoring and error handling

## Documentation

All technical evidence and architectural details are documented in:

- **Evidence:** `docs/soap-vs-rest-evidence.md` - Complete technical validation
- **Architecture:** `docs/architecture.md` - Detailed solution design
- **README:** Updated with service type clarification

## Discussion Points

### For Team Alignment

1. **Confirm Understanding:** Is everyone aligned that backend is SOAP-only?
2. **Adapter Approach:** Any concerns about the translation layer?
3. **Timeline Impact:** Does this change our delivery schedule?
4. **Resource Allocation:** Any additional expertise needed for SOAP integration?

### For Stakeholder Updates

1. **Risk Mitigation:** How do we communicate this to other stakeholders?
2. **Success Metrics:** How do we measure adapter performance?
3. **Future Planning:** Any impact on long-term architecture plans?

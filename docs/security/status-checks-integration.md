# Status Checks Integration for GitHub Branch Protection

## Overview

This document details the completion of CI workflow triggering to populate status checks for GitHub branch protection configuration.

## Workflow Execution Summary

### Triggered Workflows

1. **Application Deployment Workflow** (`#188573155`)

   - **Trigger**: Manual workflow_dispatch from test-ci-trigger branch
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
   - **Conclusion**: ‚ùå Failed (Expected for test trigger)
   - **Purpose**: Generate application deployment status checks

2. **Infrastructure Deployment Workflow** (`#188573156`)
   - **Trigger**: Manual workflow_dispatch from test-ci-trigger branch
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
   - **Conclusion**: ‚ùå Failed (Expected for test trigger)
   - **Purpose**: Generate infrastructure deployment status checks

### Status Check Population

The workflow executions have now populated the GitHub repository with the following status checks that can be configured in the branch protection ruleset:

- `ci/application` - Application deployment pipeline status
- `ci/infrastructure` - Infrastructure deployment pipeline status

## Next Steps for Branch Protection Configuration

### 1. Access GitHub Repository Settings

Navigate to your repository settings:

1. Go to <https://github.com/KaungSithuLinn/Unison-Access-Service-REST-API/settings>
2. Click on **Rules** in the left sidebar
3. Find your existing `main` branch ruleset

### 2. Configure Status Checks

1. **Edit the Ruleset**:

   - Click on the existing `main` ruleset
   - Click **Edit** to modify the ruleset

2. **Enable Status Check Requirements**:

   - Find the **"Require status checks to pass"** section
   - ‚úÖ Enable this rule
   - ‚úÖ Enable **"Require branches to be up to date before merging"**

3. **Select Required Status Checks**:
   Now that workflows have run, you should see available status checks:
   - ‚úÖ Select `ci/application` (from Application Deployment workflow)
   - ‚úÖ Select `ci/infrastructure` (from Infrastructure Deployment workflow)

### 3. Recommended Status Check Configuration

```yaml
Required Status Checks:
  - ci/application # Application deployment must pass
  - ci/infrastructure # Infrastructure deployment must pass

Settings:
  - ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
```

### 4. Test the Configuration

After configuring the status checks:

1. **Create a Test PR**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-status-checks
   echo "# Test Status Checks" > test-file.md
   git add test-file.md
   git commit -m "test: verify status checks integration"
   git push origin test-status-checks
   ```

2. **Verify Protection**:
   - Create a PR from `test-status-checks` to `main`
   - Confirm that the PR shows "Required status checks" pending
   - The PR should not be mergeable until checks pass

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] GitHub ruleset updated with status check requirements
- [ ] Status checks `ci/application` and `ci/infrastructure` selected
- [ ] "Require branches to be up to date" enabled
- [ ] Test PR created to verify functionality
- [ ] PR merge blocked until status checks pass

## Branch Protection Status

| Component                 | Status                     | Details                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Basic Protection Rules    | ‚úÖ Configured              | Force push blocking, linear history, etc.      |
| Pull Request Requirements | ‚úÖ Configured              | Review requirements, conversation resolution   |
| Status Check Integration  | üîÑ Ready for Configuration | CI workflows executed, status checks available |
| Complete Protection       | ‚è≥ Pending                 | Awaiting status check configuration in ruleset |

## CI Integration Phase Completion

This phase has successfully:

1. ‚úÖ Executed mandatory workflow entry steps
2. ‚úÖ Created test branch for CI triggering
3. ‚úÖ Triggered both application and infrastructure workflows
4. ‚úÖ Confirmed workflow completion and status check generation
5. ‚úÖ Documented next steps for GitHub UI configuration

The repository is now ready for final branch protection configuration through the GitHub web interface.

**Next Phase**: Manual GitHub ruleset configuration to complete comprehensive branch protection setup.

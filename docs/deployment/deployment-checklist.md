- [ ] Configure appropriate access permissions

## Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Deployment (Development) ðŸš€

1. **Validate Terraform Configuration**

   ```bash
   cd infrastructure
   terraform fmt -check
   terraform validate
   ```

2. **Initialize Development Environment**

   ```bash
   terraform init \
     -backend-config="resource_group_name=unison-terraform-state-dev-rg" \
     -backend-config="storage_account_name=unisonterraformstatedev" \
     -backend-config="container_name=tfstate" \
     -backend-config="key=unison-access-service/dev/terraform.tfstate"
   ```

3. **Plan Development Deployment**

   ```bash
   terraform plan -var-file="environments/development.tfvars"
   ```

4. **Deploy Development Infrastructure**

   ```bash
   terraform apply -var-file="environments/development.tfvars"
   ```

5. **Verify Development Deployment**
   - [ ] Resource group created successfully
   - [ ] App Service deployed and running
   - [ ] Key Vault accessible
   - [ ] Application Insights configured
   - [ ] Container Registry available

### Phase 2: Application Deployment (Development) ðŸ“¦

1. **Build and Push Container Image**

   - GitHub Actions will automatically build and push on main branch push

2. **Deploy Application**

   - GitHub Actions will automatically deploy to development environment

3. **Verify Application Deployment**
   - [ ] Health endpoint responding (200 OK)
   - [ ] Swagger UI accessible
   - [ ] API endpoints functional
   - [ ] Telemetry data flowing to Application Insights

### Phase 3: Staging Environment ðŸ”„

1. **Deploy Infrastructure to Staging**

   - Use GitHub Actions workflow with staging environment selection

2. **Deploy Application to Staging**

   - Automatic deployment after successful development deployment

3. **Staging Validation**
   - [ ] Performance tests passing
   - [ ] Integration tests successful
   - [ ] User acceptance testing completed

### Phase 4: Production Deployment ðŸŽ¯

1. **Final Pre-Production Checks**

   - [ ] All staging tests passed
   - [ ] Backup procedures verified
   - [ ] Rollback plan prepared
   - [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

2. **Deploy Production Infrastructure**

   - Use GitHub Actions workflow with production environment selection
   - Requires manual approval

3. **Deploy Production Application**

   - Use GitHub Actions workflow with production environment selection
   - Requires manual approval

4. **Post-Production Validation**
   - [ ] Health checks passing
   - [ ] Performance within acceptable limits
   - [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
   - [ ] Backup verification completed

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Monitoring Setup ðŸ“Š

- [ ] Configure Application Insights alerts
- [ ] Set up availability tests
- [ ] Configure log analytics queries
- [ ] Set up dashboard for monitoring

### Security Hardening ðŸ”’

- [ ] Review and update Key Vault access policies
- [ ] Configure network security groups
- [ ] Enable diagnostic logging
- [ ] Set up security center recommendations

### Documentation ðŸ“š

- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Document configuration settings
- [ ] Create operational runbooks
- [ ] Update disaster recovery procedures

### Team Communication ðŸ“¢

- [ ] Notify stakeholders of successful deployment
- [ ] Share production URLs and documentation
- [ ] Schedule post-deployment review meeting
- [ ] Update project status

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Terraform Deployment Fails

1. Check Azure credentials and permissions
2. Verify subscription quotas
3. Check resource naming conflicts
4. Review error logs in GitHub Actions

#### Application Deployment Fails

1. Check container image build logs
2. Verify Azure Web App configuration
3. Check Key Vault access permissions
4. Review application logs

#### Health Check Fails

1. Check application startup logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Check database connectivity
4. Verify SOAP service connectivity

### Emergency Procedures

#### Rollback Application

```bash
# Use GitHub Actions rollback workflow
# Or manual rollback via Azure CLI
az webapp deployment slot swap \
  --name unison-access-service-prod \
  --resource-group unison-access-service-prod-rg \
  --slot production \
  --target-slot staging
```

#### Emergency Stop

```bash
# Stop the web app
az webapp stop \
  --name unison-access-service-prod \
  --resource-group unison-access-service-prod-rg
```

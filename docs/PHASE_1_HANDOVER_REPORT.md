## Next Agent's Entry Command

```bash
# Phase 2 Entry Protocol
git pull origin main --rebase
```

**Next Phase Execution**: 
```
Execute Phase 2: Intelligent Planning with AI-optimized infrastructure generation using Terraform MCP, component design with Sequential-Thinking MCP pattern suggestions, and threat modeling with Copilot Chat assistance.
```

**Required Actions for Phase 2**:
1. **IaC Generation**: Use Terraform MCP + Copilot Chat for cost/security optimized modules
2. **Component Design**: AI-suggested patterns (circuit breaker, adapter scaling) via Sequential-Thinking
3. **Threat Modeling**: AI-assisted security analysis for adapter risks (XML injection, etc.)

**Phase 2 Entry Checklist**:
- [ ] Read `chat_summary.md` for Phase 1 completion context
- [ ] Review `specs/latest/spec.md` for updated specification
- [ ] Check `memory/current_phase.json` (should show "Phase 2 Ready")
- [ ] Validate Phase 1 artifacts: user-stories.md, api-schema.yaml, metrics-baseline.md

## Remaining Risks / Blockers

### Technical Debt (Low-Medium Priority)
- **Markdown Linting**: Documentation files have formatting issues (MD022, MD032 violations)
  - **Impact**: Cosmetic only, does not affect functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Address during Phase 2 documentation review

- **Schema Validation**: OpenAPI specification requires Postman collection testing
  - **Impact**: Medium - schema correctness not yet validated
  - **Mitigation**: Phase 2 should include API validation with Postman MCP

### Infrastructure Dependencies (Medium-High Priority)
- **Monitoring Implementation**: Performance framework defined but not implemented
  - **Impact**: High - production readiness depends on monitoring
  - **Mitigation**: Phase 2 Terraform IaC must include monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana)

- **SOAP Service Integration**: Adapter implementation not yet started
  - **Impact**: High - core functionality blocker
  - **Mitigation**: Phase 4 implementation will address with generated specifications

### Quality Assurance Gaps
- **End-to-End Testing**: Playwright scenarios defined but not implemented
  - **Impact**: Medium - testing automation incomplete
  - **Mitigation**: Phase 4 will implement full testing suite

- **Security Validation**: OWASP requirements defined but not tested
  - **Impact**: Medium - security posture needs validation
  - **Mitigation**: Phase 5 security scanning and penetration testing

## Framework Performance Assessment

### AI Integration Success Metrics

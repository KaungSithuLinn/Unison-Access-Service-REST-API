**AI Assessment**: Future-proofing opportunity - supports organizational scaling

## ADR-006: Event-Driven Observability

**Date**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Future Consideration  
**Context**: SOAP operations lack modern observability and domain event tracking  
**Decision**: Implement domain event publishing for adapter operations  
**Consequences**:

- ‚úÖ Enhanced monitoring and business intelligence
- ‚úÖ Decoupled analytics and audit capabilities
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional infrastructure for event streaming

**AI Assessment**: Valuable for operational excellence - consider for Phase 2

## ADR-007: Security-by-Design Enhancement

**Date**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Proposed
